        <h1>Golaž</h1>
        <p>
            Golaž is one of the best dishes in the world, in my humble opinion.
        </p>
        <p>One of it's best attributes is that it's very simple to cook and I'll tell you how.</p>
        <h2>The recipe</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Enogh tommato souce</li>
            <li>Couple of laurel leaves</li>
            <li>Spices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Notes about the ingredients:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef cuts are better the calf's, so please keep in mind while shoping.</li>
            <li>Best beef cuts for golaž are shanks, from the side of the cow.</li>
            <li>Quantity of the onions mainly influences how thick the stew is in the end. 
                The golden ratio is said to be 1:1 meat to onions, 
                but it's never followed except on some special occasions like birthday celebrations.
                to enhance thickness you can just add apple or flour.</li>
                <li>Common ammount of meat is 1 kg</li>
            <li>Common spices include salt, pepper, basil and whatever you heart desires.
                Personally I add cloves.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Dice onions and chop the beef into chunks.
                <ul><li>
                    The only important thing to take care of 
                that all beef chunks are even. Best shape for that is a cube. 
                The size only matters in terms of cooking time.
                </li><li>
                    Smaller chunks cook  faster.
                </li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                In pot roast onion in oil until it's nice golden colour. 
                <ul><li>Burned onion leave bitter taste.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add beef cubes. Grill on each side just a little. 
                <ul><li>Do not cook them through, 
                    as this step is only to allow chunks to keep shape in the final dish.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add tomato sauce and bring to boil.
            </li>
            <li>Add spices and add water until it's decently full pot.</li>
            <li>Cook on low fire for up to 4 hours. 
                <ul><li>
                    Cooking time depends on a lot of factors, so my 
                advice is just to try if the meat is cooked through and is really soft.
                </li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve in bowls with bread.
            </li>
        </ol>
